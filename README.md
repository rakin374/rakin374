ðŸ‘‹ Hi, my name is Rakin Munim

Welcome to my GitHub! Feel free to hop around and examine some of the software systems I have worked on. 

I am a young individual interested in learning about our reality. I have studied computer science formally but am also interested in physics. I love thinking about what's possible in this universe(it seems limitless). Additionally, I have recently begun studying the humanities more often dabbling in subjects like art history and music.
